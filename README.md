# Software Renderer

An example software renderer, using pixeltoaster to do our pixel pushing.

Following this lovely little tutorial: https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki/Lesson-0:-getting-started

## helloworld

Just a simple test of PixelToaster, opens a window and updates some of the pixels.

## linedrawing

Line drawing and little else.

## modeldraw

Load a wavefront obj file and display the lines (we use X,Y and ignore Z, plus we assume scale).

## tridraw

Triangle rasterisation first pass.
